Incantio builds the infrastructure for modern sync licensing.

We develop:
- AI-based recommendation and similarity-search systems
- Music ingestion, metadata, and tagging pipelines
- Pricing, licensing, and rights-management services
- Creator tools for browsing, previewing, and licensing tracks
- Artist tools for catalog management and payouts

Our platform empowers independent musicians to self-license directly to creators — with clear pricing, direct payments, and no middlemen.
